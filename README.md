This is a simplified implementation of Ethereum's modified Merkle Patricia Trie based on [Ethereum's yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

- This implementation is simple because it doesn't involve tree encoding/decoding, data persistence.
- Its purely focused on the algorithm and data structure.
- It's not made for production use, but for learning purpose.
